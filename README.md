# Open Food Facts Explorer: the modern JS frontend to Open Food Facts

## Warning

- Please ask assignment before starting to code. First asking, first assigned. We have enough issues for everyone. Please open a matching issue and get consensus before raising PRs.
- DO NOT create a bug and its PR at the same time. Create the issue first and ask to be assigned.
- Do not try to race other contributors to solving an issue. Try something else, or try collaborating or helping one another on solving it.
- DO NOT jump to implement an open issue before an agreement is reached on the design.
- LINT your PRs before sending them pnpm
- Please mention GenAI tool you used if you used it (Copilot in an IDE, Copilot Workspace, Gemini…)

## Design

- openfoodfacts-explorer is our experimental, next gen frontend. The idea is to reach feature parity on the essential stuff with the main frontend to eventually replace it, with a much better responsive UI (80%+ of our traffic is mobile web).
- We currently don’t have any real visual mockup of it, nor “artistic direction” so for the time being, we're copying key features from the current frontend, improving them whenever we can.
