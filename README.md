# Open Food Facts Explorer: the modern JS frontend to Open Food Facts

openfoodfacts-explorer is our experimental, next gen frontend. The idea is to reach feature parity on the essential stuff with the main frontend to eventually replace it, with a much better responsive UI (80%+ of our traffic is mobile web).

## Warning on the usage of AI tools

We support the usage of AI tools to enhance productivity, but we expect you to review and test any code generated by these tools before opening a Pull Request. For more information, see the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- Uses the [official Open Food Facts NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-nodejs)
- Basic editing
- Product page display, including Knowledge Panels support
- Search
- Login support (simple login, NOT SECURE)
- Folksonomy Engine Support

## Design

- We currently don’t have any real visual mockup of it, nor “artistic direction” so for the time being, we're copying key features from the current frontend, improving them whenever we can.
