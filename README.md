# Open Food Facts Explorer: the modern JS frontend to Open Food Facts

"Explorer" is the codename for the next gen frontend for Open Food Facts, built with modern web technologies (SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, etc). It is currently in early development, and is not yet ready for production use. However, it is already possible to use it for development and testing purposes.

By building a new frontend, we want to be able to iterate faster on the user experience, provide a more modern and responsive design, and make it easier for contributors to contribute to the frontend.

## Warning on the usage of AI tools

## Design

> **New to the project?** Check out our **[UX Contributing Guide](UX_GUIDE.md)** for patterns, colors, and best practices.

- We currently don’t have any real visual mockup of it, nor “artistic direction” so for the time being, we're copying key features from the current frontend, improving them whenever we can.

```

Before running the project, set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file as needed to configure your development environment.

Then start the development server:
