# Contrituting to OpenFoodFacts Explorer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenFoodFacts Explorer project! This document outlines how you can contribute, report issues, and collaborate with the community.

## Use of LLMs and AI tools

**We encourage responsible use of AI tools to enhance productivity while maintaining code quality. However, please ensure that any code generated by these tools is thoroughly reviewed and tested before opening a Pull Request.**

## Working on features

**Please open an issue before starting to work on a feature.** This helps us track progress and avoid duplicate efforts.

If you see an issue that you would like to work on, please follow these guidelines:

- **Open an issue**: If the issue does not already exist, create a new one describing the feature or bug you want to address.
- **Get assigned**: Request to be assigned to the issue. This helps us manage contributions and avoid conflicts.
  - If the issue is small you can start working on it right away, but please still open an issue.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
3. Make your changes, test them locally and **lint the code**. If you are using `pnpm`, you can run:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

   This will help ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards.

   After that, stage your changes and commit them with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
   ```

   We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages, so please follow that format.

4. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
    git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original repository.
6. In your PR description, reference the issue you are addressing (e.g., "Fixes #123") and provide a clear explanation of your changes, following the suggested template.

## Design & UX Guidelines

This project has a specific design system (Tailwind CSS v4 + DaisyUI v5). Before building any UI, please read our **[UX Contributing Guide](UX_GUIDE.md)** to ensure consistency.

## Collaborating on Issues

Please feel free to comment on existing issues, suggest improvements, or ask questions. We encourage collaboration and discussion to ensure the best outcomes for the project.

Remember to be respectful and constructive in your comments. If you disagree with a suggestion or approach, provide your reasoning and be open to discussion. Remember that we're all here to improve the project together and most of us are volunteers.
